                        <p>In 2002, the dream of creating Baldwin Stables became a reality. Jack and Karen Baldwin
                            purchased
                            the
                            facility and went
                            to work renovating and improving the property. Today, we proudly provide our clients with a
                            well
                            maintained and groomed
                            stable.</p>
