                    Karen Baldwin is a National Champion trainer with over 25 years of experience. She believes in
                    developing a partnership
                    between horse and rider.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Although her passion is the Arabian breed, she enjoys the challenge of working with any horse who
                    can benefit from her
                    experience. She welcomes all breeds and levels in for training.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Karen is experienced in working with youngsters who are ready to be backed for the first time,
                    horses who may need to be
                    tuned up before the riding season starts, and in putting the finishing touches on the national
                    caliber horse. As she
                    works with your horse, you are encouraged to take a weekly lesson to experience the progression of
                    your horse's
                    training.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Training methods vary for each individual horse to encourage maximum acquisition of both skills and
                    strength. Training
                    includes, but is not limited to, riding, jogging and/or bitting rigs, long lining or cardio fitness
                    workouts. The amount
                    a horse is worked is determined by age, health, ability and the goals by the owner.
